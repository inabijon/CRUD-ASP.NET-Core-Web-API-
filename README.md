Welcome to the .NET 6 Core Web API GitHub repository!

This repository contains the code for a simple Web API built on top of .NET 6 Core. The API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from a backend database. It also includes examples of best practices for structuring and organizing code in a Web API project.

Technologies Used
.NET 6 Core
Entity Framework Core
Swagger UI
AutoMapper
Newtonsoft.Json
Getting Started
Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git.
Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or later.
Build the solution to restore all NuGet packages.
Set the WebAPI project as the startup project.
In the appsettings.json file, modify the connection string to point to your own database.
Run the application.

Best Practices
This project follows best practices for building a scalable and maintainable Web API, including:

Separation of concerns between data access, business logic, and API controllers.
Use of dependency injection for loose coupling between components.
Use of data transfer objects (DTOs) to avoid exposing domain models in the API.
Use of AutoMapper for mapping between DTOs and domain models.
Use of exception handling middleware for centralized error handling.
Use of repository pattern for data access.
Conclusion
This repository provides a great starting point for building a Web API with .NET 6 Core. It includes examples of best practices and commonly used technologies. Feel free to use this project as a reference or starting point for your own Web API projects.
